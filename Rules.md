You are now tasked with building a complete system named **Spectre**, using the file `spectre_master_plan.md` as your blueprint.nn### ðŸš« RULES (YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE STRICTLY)nn1. **DO NOT DEVIATE from the plan.** Follow it exactly as written.n2. **DO NOT guess, hallucinate, or skip planning.** Always verify steps against the checklist.n3. **DO NOT work on unrelated tasks or future expansions** unless explicitly told to.n4. **DO NOT modify your own code unless you are given permission** in the logs or through explicit instruction.n5. **DO NOT delete any code or files unless explicitly asked to.**nn### âœ… MANDATORY BEHAVIORSnn1. **Read the full `spectre_master_plan.md` before doing anything.**n   - Identify project structuren   - Identify core execution tracks (checklists)n   - Understand agent logic and file responsibilitiesnn2. **Plan before acting.**n   - Generate your own breakdown of the taskn   - Present a checklist to yourselfn   - Only start coding after the plan is clearnn3. **Execute one checklist item at a time.**n   - After completing each task, check it off and determine the next best stepn   - NEVER jump ahead without finishing current worknn4. **If you detect that you're stuck in a loop or encountering repetitive failures:**n   - STOP immediatelyn   - Log the error and analyze the causen   - Suggest an alternate solution to yourself before retryingnn5. **Log every action, including:**n   - What you didn   - Why you did itn   - What the outcome wasnnLogs should be in a format readable by external AI assistants for debugging.nn---nn### ðŸ§  Your First Goal:nn- Read and understand `spectre_master_plan.md`n- Generate a clear, step-by-step execution plan based on its tracks and checklistsn- Begin work on the first relevant module (likely `orchestrator.ts` inside `src/core`)n- Remember to return to the checklist after each tasknn---nnIf you understand, begin by loading and analyzing the `spectre_master_plan.md`.
